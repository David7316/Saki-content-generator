Am I the asshole for refusing to give up my college fund to help my parent with their debt? I just started college this year. ever since i was little, my grandparents set up a college fund for me, and it’s the only reason i can afford school without taking on massive debt. my parents always knew about it, and it was always meant for my education. recently, my parents have been struggling financially due to bad investments and overspending. They sat me down and asked me to use my college fund to help them pay off their debts. they said that since they raised me, it’s only fair that i help them now that they’re struggling. i said no. i told them i was grateful for everything they’ve done, but this money was specifically for my education, and i wasn’t going to throw away my future. they got upset and said i was being selfish and ungrateful. my mom even cried, saying she never thought her own daughter would turn her back on them. Now my parents barely talk to me. i feel horrible, but at the same time, i don’t think i should have to sacrifice my future because of their financial mistakes. aita for refusing to give up my college fund?
