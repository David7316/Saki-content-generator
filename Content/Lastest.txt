Am I the asshole for correcting my in-laws when they mispronounce my name? I (27F) have a name that isn’t super common in the U.S., but it’s not that hard to pronounce. Think something like “Leena,” but my in-laws keep saying “Lana.” It’s a small difference, but it makes my name sound completely different. I’ve been with my husband (30M) for five years, married for two, and his parents have *never* gotten it right. At first, I thought they just needed time to adjust. They’re in their 60s, and I get that learning a new name might take a second. But we see them often, and I’ve corrected them *so many times*. My husband says I should let it go because “it’s not intentional,” but at what point does it stop being accidental and start being just… dismissive? It’s not like they struggle with pronunciation in general. They can say names like “Giovanni” or “Schwarzenegger” just fine. My husband’s mom even talks about how much she *loves* learning about different cultures, but when it comes to my name, she always shrugs it off with, “Well, you know who I mean!”

The last straw was at a family dinner last weekend. His mom was introducing me to her friend and said, “This is our daughter-in-law, Lana.” I laughed a little and said, “Almost! It’s Leena.” She sighed and said, “Oh, you’re so particular,” in front of everyone. It was embarrassing. I just smiled and let it go, but later, I told my husband I didn’t think it was fair. He got defensive and said I was making his mom feel bad over something “so small.”

I honestly don’t think I’m being unreasonable. I’m not asking them to learn a new language, just my *actual* name. But now I feel like I’m being *that* person—overly sensitive and nitpicking. My best friend says I should just answer to it because “older people don’t change,” but I don’t want to set the precedent that my name doesn’t matter. Am I the asshole for continuing to correct them?
