Am I the asshole for refusing to help my best friend with her wedding because she didn’t make me a bridesmaid? My best friend [24F] we’ll call her may, and I [24F] have been close since middle school. We’ve talked about being in each others weddings, so when she got engaged last year, i assumed I’d be a bridesmaid. She recently asked me to help with the wedding planning, but when she showed me the list for her bridal party, I wasn’t on the list. I asked why, and she got awkward and said she had to make some choices. The party included her sister, her fiancés sister, and a few newer friends she’s known for a couple of years. She wanted a small party. I didn’t want to make it a big deal though. I congratulated her and figured I’d still be a guest. But then she started asking me for a lot of help, things like dress shopping, DIY decorations, venue hunting, making party favors, etc etc.. I finally told her, “Hey, I love you, but I feel weird doing all of this when I’m not even a bridesmaid.” She got angry and said that she thought I’d still want to be involved because we’re best friends. I told her I’d still be at the wedding, but I wasn’t gonna do all of this extra work when she didn’t even consider me close enough to be at her bridal party. Now she and some of our mutual friends are giving me the cold shoulder, saying I’m being petty and making the wedding “about me.” But I’m not gonna be doing bridesmaid-level work if I’m not one. Am I the asshole?? ?
