Am I the asshole for telling my boyfriends kids to eat what’s for dinner or don’t eat at all? I27f have been with my boyfriend30 for a little over a year now. We recently moved in together. I have a 8 year old from an ex, and my boyfriend has 2 kids ages 6 and 9. Since we moved in together I now have his children every weekend and he works fridays, so I am alone with them til he is off work. Friday night I made meatloaf with roasted broccoli and mash potatoes. My son eats well, he knows to eat the best he can, and if he don’t finish his food that’s okay but he atleast has to eat the most he can unless he don’t want a before bedtime snack. I hold my boyfriend children to these same rules which we haven’t had any issues with til Friday night. Neither of the kids liked the food, the 9 year old ate it, the 6 year old refused in which I said I’m not making you another meal, so he went to bed without dinner. When my boyfriend got home his 6 year old was complaining he was hungry and my boyfriend got upset with me that I refused to make him something else. I told him I wouldn’t hold his children to different rules then my child. He got upset and ended up making him something else to eat, then told me that was horrible of me to “deny a child dinner” and blamed it on his young age, explaining I had to be more lenient. I explained that I had raised a young child before and I was once a young child and followed those same rules, which just resulted in a huge argument, and him calling me ignorant. Today we got a call from my boyfriends ex, and now the children don’t want to come til Saturday, or Friday night late when my boyfriend is off work. This caused another big argument between my boyfriend and I. He once again called me an ignorant ahole, and said I needed to change my way of thinking. Am I the asshole? Add: I did not force this kid to go to bed hungry, I suggested him to eat a larger portion of his mash potatoes and smaller portion of other things which he refused, and he didn’t want to make anything else himself.
